#### Please, don't use the master branch (I'm not really testing when commiting to master!!), use a version branch when available!!

*Docker Hub* https://hub.docker.com/r/galexrt/zulip/

##### WARNING! This is currently work in progress. It's not fully "working" yet, but it should work sometime soon.

In the folder [includes/zulip](includes/zulip) are modified zulip manifestss for puppet.
The manifests are modified to "just" install zulip not more, not less and work good in docker.
